![A Guppy, Poecilia reticulata](hexno.jpeg)

Shown above is a picture of guppies I used to have, a male in the front and a female in the back.

These weren't of any specific strain, but were beautiful nonetheless. They seem to have been a mixed *Dumbo Guppy*, characterized by opaque black pectoral fins.

Below is my experience caring for and setting up aquariums to house these beautiful fish.

### Care

Here I'll be going over my care experience of these fish. 

#### Conditions

Guppies grow in almost all environments, with the key being stability. Though adaptive, they are still delicate fish, with their immune systems being compromised if large changes are made frequently.

For example, I've kept them in ideal heated and unheated aquarium conditions, and also in a shallow pond outside (half whiskey barrel) Outdoors, temperatures get up to 120 degrees f. However, because our temperatures remain high during the summer, they are suited to these conditions and can even reproduce readily.

Since guppies do not rely on substrate, any substrate for their enclosure works. Most of my tanks have a sand-based substrate, which I find works best for plants.
