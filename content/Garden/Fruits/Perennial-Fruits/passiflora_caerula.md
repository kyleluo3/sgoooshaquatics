*Passiflora caerula*, the Blue Passionflower, with passiflora meaning "passion flower" and caerula meaning "blue" in latin, blooms with otherworldy flowers in perfect radial symmetry. The blue passionflower is prominent in Christianity as a symbol of Jesus' crucifixion. The vine bears a fruit as alienlike as the flower which came before it. An airy and yellow-orange oblong fruit contains a packet of slimy red seeds suspended in the middle of the fruit by sponge-like fibers.

1. Growth:
Two words that best describe the growing nature of Passiflora caerula are "sprawling" and "reaching". As a *liana*, a woody vine that relies on other plants, such as self-supportive trees and bushes, as a way to reach higher on the canopy.







Nectar is stored in a bowl-like structure where the fronds grow out of. As bees or butterflies drink this nectar, they brush upon the downward facing anthers, sticking pollen to their fuzzy backsides. When going about the few individual flowers that bloom per day on this vine, they brush this pollen onto relatively large stigmas, which are, interestingly enough, facing downwards as well.
